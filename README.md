# benchmark-ips

* https://github.com/evanphx/benchmark-ips

* [documentation](http://rubydoc.info/gems/benchmark-ips)

## DESCRIPTION:

A iterations per second enhancement to Benchmark.

## FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

 * benchmark/ips - benchmarks a blocks iterations/second. For short snippits
   of code, ips automatically figures out how many times to run the code
   to get interesting data. No more guessing at random iteration counts!

## SYNOPSIS:

```ruby
require 'benchmark/ips'

Benchmark.ips do |x|
  # Configure the number of seconds used during
  # the warmup phase (default 2) and calculation phase (default 5)
  x.config(:time => 5, :warmup => 2)

  # These parameters can also be configured this way
  x.time = 5
  x.warmup = 2

  # Typical mode, runs the block as many times as it can
  x.report("addition") { 1 + 2 }

  # To reduce overhead, the number of iterations is passed in
  # and the block must run the code the specific number of times.
  # Used for when the workload is very small and any overhead
  # introduces incorrectable errors.
  x.report("addition2") do |times|
    i = 0
    while i < times
      1 + 2
      i += 1
    end
  end

  # To reduce overhead even more, grafts the code given into
  # the loop that performs the iterations internally to reduce
  # overhead. Typically not needed, use the |times| form instead.
  x.report("addition3", "1 + 2")

  # Really long labels should be formatted correctly
  x.report("addition-test-long-label") { 1 + 2 }

  # Compare the iterations per second of the various reports!
  x.compare!
end
```

This will generate the following report:

```

Benchmark/ips will report the number of iterations per second for a given block
of code. When analyzing the results, notice the percent of [standard
deviation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard\_deviation) which tells us how
spread out our measurements are from the average. A high standard deviation
could indicate the results having too much variability.

One benefit to using this method is benchmark-ips automatically determines the
data points for testing our code, so we can focus on the results instead of
guessing iteration counts as we do with the traditional Benchmark library.

### Custom Suite

Pass a custom suite to disable garbage collection during benchmark:

```ruby
require 'benchmark/ips'

# Enable and start GC before each job run. Disable GC afterwards.
#
# Inspired by https://www.omniref.com/ruby/2.2.1/symbols/Benchmark/bm?#annotation=4095926&line=182
class GCSuite
  def warming(*)
    run_gc
  end

  def running(*)
    run_gc
  end

  def warmup_stats(*)
  end

  def add_report(*)
  end

  private

  def run_gc
    GC.enable
    GC.start
    GC.disable
  end
end

suite = GCSuite.new

Benchmark.ips do |x|
  x.config(:suite => suite)
  x.report("job1") { ... }
  x.report("job2") { ... }
end
```

### Independent benchmarking

If you are comparing multiple implementations of a piece of code you may want
to benchmark them in separate invocations of Ruby so that the measurements
are independent of each other. You can do this with the `hold!` command.

```ruby
Benchmark.ips do |x|
  
  ...
  
  # Hold results between multiple invocations of Ruby
  x.hold! 'filename'
  
end
```

This will run only one benchmarks each time you run the command, storing
results in the specified file. The file is deleted when all results have been
gathered and the report is shown.
