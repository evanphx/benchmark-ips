puts <<-EOD
Typical results will show addition2 & addition3 to be the most performant, and
they should perform reasonably similarly. You should see addition and
addition-test-long-label to perform very similarly to each other (as they are
running the same test, just with different labels), and they should both run in
the neighborhood of 3.5 times slower than addition2 and addition3."
